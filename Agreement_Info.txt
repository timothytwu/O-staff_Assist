---FOR DEPARTMMENT ENDPOINT---
Unsorted array, each element a course relationship

You can tell what kind of articulation each is by referencing item.type.
    > Item types:
        Course: 1 course at UCSB to 1 course at CC
        Series: Multiple courses at UCSB to any number of courses at CC
        CourseGroup: 1 course at UCSB to 2 or more courses at CC

Accessing UCSB Course Info
Course and CourseGroup: UCSB course info is listed under item.course
Series: If mapped to multiple courses at UCSB, UCSB course info on all courses is in item.series object.
    > For this, it's easiest to use item.series.name to describe the series it maps to.

Note difference between CourseGroup made up of courses lmao
    > Here's a good rule of thumb for handling these:
        data.forEach(agreement => agreement.sendingArticulation.items.forEach(courseGroup => courseGroup.items.forEach(course => console.log(course))));


SendingArticulaton is always the course at the cc
Course/Series is always the course at UCSB
